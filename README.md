# LHL Sortify, A Smart TO-DO List

## Contributors

Angela Tabafunda, Catherine Mitchell, Ashwini Hegde

## Project Introduction

- A SMART list app that has an auto-categorizing feature to make sure that your entry reaches the correct category automatically.
- If the entry does not fit into any of the automatic categories, then the app will categorize it into an unsorted list, so that you can still view your entry.
- Users will be able to change a category of an item in case it was mis-categorized or could not be categorized at all.

### Sorting
- For a more accurate automatic sorting, use keywords such as: Buy, Eat, Watch, Read, Cook
- If no context was given, WolframAPI will handle the sorting which might not be accurate
- No automatic sorting happens when a user manually specifies a category


## Getting Started

1. Create the `.env` by using `.env.example` as a reference: `cp .env.example .env`
2. Update the .env file with your correct local information 
  - username: `labber` 
  - password: `labber` 
  - database: `midterm`
3. Install dependencies: `npm i`
4. Fix to binaries for sass: `npm rebuild node-sass`
5. Reset database: `npm run db:reset`
  - Check the db folder to see what gets created and seeded in the SDB
6. Obtain an APPID from `https://products.wolframalpha.com/api/documentation` by creating an account.  Once your account is created, log in, go to My APPs    tab and follow instructions to create the APPID.  Paste this APPID into the `.env` file.    
7. Run the server: `npm run local`
  - Note: nodemon is used, so you should not have to restart your server
8. Visit `http://localhost:8080/`

## Warnings & Tips

- Do not edit the `layout.css` file directly, it is auto-generated by `layout.scss`.
- Split routes into their own resource-based file names, as demonstrated with `users.js` and `widgets.js`.
- Split database schema (table definitions) and seeds (inserts) into separate files, one per table. See `db` folder for pre-populated examples. 
- Use helper functions to run your SQL queries and clean up any data coming back from the database. See `db/queries` for pre-populated examples.
- Use the `npm run db:reset` command each time there is a change to the database schema or seeds. 
  - It runs through each of the files, in order, and executes them against the database. 
  - Note: you will lose all newly created (test) data each time this is run, since the schema files will tend to `DROP` the tables and recreate them.

## Dependencies

- Node 10.x or above
- NPM 5.x or above
